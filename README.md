# i3-workspace-auto-rename
This pthon code automatically renames your i3-bar workspaces based on their contents. It was really helpful for me so far. Enjoy!

## Usage
Make it executable : `sudo chmod +x ./rename_workspaces.py` or just run it like this: `/usr/bin/python3 /home/<your-username>/rename_workspaces.py`.
